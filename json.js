// XML ===> Extensible Markup Language

// <?xml>
//     <company>
//         <name>TCS</name>
//         <turnover>2 milllion</turnover>
//     </company>
// </xml>

//XML was too strict and complex to write. And it was heavy weighted.

// Instead of XML JSON was introduced and widely used
//JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation

//example
[{"color":"White","company":[{"car":"skoda","bike":"Honda"}]},{"fruit":"Orange"}]
